# Server Scripts
This repository is all the scripts that I use when deploying a new server and need it up and running from boot up, I've made this public because I know the hassle of trying to get servers up and running.

# Download all the scripts
``sudo apt-get update``

``sudo apt-get install git -y``

``git clone https://github.com/SimDifRandomHD/server-scripts.git -b master``

Or install everything that I use from starting a server for the first time or using the terminal:

``sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimDifRandomHD/server-scripts/master/server.sh -O -)"``
