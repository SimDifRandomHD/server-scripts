# Server Scripts
This repository is all the scripts that I use when deploying a new server and need it up and running from boot up, I've made this public because I know the hassle of trying to get servers up and running.

# Download all the scripts
``sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install git -y; git clone https://github.com/SimDifRandomHD/server-scripts.git -b master``
